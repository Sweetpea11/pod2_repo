of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis. \nThose three have made good\
developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram. \nBut, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron,  \
Davis, and company have put together an incredible season.\nLos Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a \
supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA.\nThe Lakers ended the season atop the Western\
Conference with a record of 49-14. \nThey were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league. \nDavis\
proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year. \nLos Angeles was a \
dominant club on both sides of the ball and are in a position to have another successful year next season.'
