<h2>My Drone Life</h2>

<p class = 'p1 fstyle'>I started droning about a year ago after seeing numerous articles and shows on tv picturing them.  My first flight was at a park near home and I thought I was an expert after that.  A couple months later, thinking I was that expert, I was flying near the Colgate clock in Jersey City and miscalculated where I was and flew my drone into the side of the Goldman Sachs Building, crashed the drone and it got stuck 40 floors up.  I was never able to recover it.
